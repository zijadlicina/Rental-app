## About Project

If you want to rent a bike in every time, this app is for you. There are two rules: user
role (who rent a bike), and role of “agency” (who put a bike in process of rental).
- You can rent many bikes in same time;
- When you rent a bike, you could give a feedback to that bike.
- Also maybe owner of the bike won’t let you rent a bike...
App give a notification process who follow of these process of renting

#### Note about project work
Process of working in this project was all time in "learning status"...

For some stuff: like authentication/authorization in frontend and backend was take code from the internet. But now, I understand what is happening there in most of this code.

But for next works, also I want the advance my knowledge about these code, like knowing the process under the hood of promise, or advance the knowing the process under the hood of React/Redux...

## Technologies
MERN Stack: NodeJS | Express | React | Redux | GitHub | HTML | CSS
## Agend for next projects:
- Using **TypeScript** in the code. Because I have experience with generics functions in C++.
- Concept of **Object Orential programming**. Because I have also experience in C++ with this concept. And it would be nice to use that and advance the knowledge of "under the hood" process in code.
- Advance works in **NodeJS** and **Express**
- **MySQL** - using the relational database and its manipulation. I have experience with this in faculty projects.
- **HTML & CSS** - more advance level
- **React** - advance the knowledge, and understanding the process "under the hood" (Because of this we are mention the OOP concept earlier).
- **Redux** and **Redux-Thunk** - knowing the process also with deep understanding
- **Testing** the code
- **Constant using the Git and GitHub**
